Iris Flower Classification
This project is completed as Task 3 for the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into different species using machine learning based on their sepal and petal measurements.
The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the target variable species. Data preprocessing was performed by encoding the species column and scaling the feature values before training the model.
A Random Forest Classifier was used to train the model after splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The model was evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test data.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Files included:
iris.csv – Dataset
iris_classification.py – Python script
