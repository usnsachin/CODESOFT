Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is completed as Task 1 for the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. The objective of the project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

The dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarkation point. Data preprocessing was performed by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns. Categorical data was converted into numerical form to prepare the dataset for model training.

A Random Forest Classifier was used to train the model after splitting the data into training and testing sets. The model was evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and a confusion matrix.

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82 percent.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Files included:

train.csv – Dataset

titanic.py – Python script

titanic_model.pkl – Saved trained model
